  <overview>
    The project online Dev Env mode handles Phase 2 of environment setup.

    Phase 1: Environment Variable Population (0_env_file_initialization.xml)
    Phase 2: Script Execution (this file)

    CRITICAL: Phase 1 MUST complete before Phase 2 begins.

    See ../../sdlc/shared/env-setup-workflow.md for:
    - Complete two-phase workflow
    - All commands and validation steps
    - Token setup instructions (Git, Jira)
    - Trigger phrases
