    CRITICAL: Explicit, executable GitLab API workflow for MR data retrieval.
    
    This rule file enforces API-first approach with NO git command-line fallbacks.
    
    Complete executable workflow with curl commands defined in:
    ../../sdlc/shared/mr-api-execution-workflow.md
    
    MANDATORY EXECUTION PATTERN:
    1. Extract MR identifier from user request (IID, URL, or branch)
    2. Source .env to load GIT_TOKEN, GITLAB_API_URL, GITLAB_PROJECT_ID
    3. Execute GitLab API calls using curl with authentication
    4. Parse JSON responses to extract MR data
    5. Present results to user
    
    PROHIBITED ACTIONS:
    - Using git log to find MR information
    - Using git branch to discover MR details
    - Falling back to git CLI when API calls are available
    - Assuming MR data without making API calls

  <priority>HIGHEST</priority>
  
  <enforcement>
    This workflow MUST be executed for ALL MR-related operations.
    NO exceptions. NO fallbacks to git commands for MR data.
