  <!--
    IMPORTANT: Project-specific customizations have been moved to markdown format.
    
    All customizations for this mode should now be added to:
    ../../shared/customizations/mr-actions-customizations.md
    
    That file:
    - Will NEVER be overwritten by setup-sdlc.sh updates
    - Provides better formatting and examples
    - Is easier to read and maintain
    - Follows the same ultra-DRY principles
    
    This XML file is kept for backward compatibility but should reference
    the markdown file for actual customizations.
