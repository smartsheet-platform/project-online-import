    DELEGATE ENVIRONMENT ISSUES, DON'T TROUBLESHOOT DIRECTLY.

    Environment troubleshooting workflow and scope boundaries defined in:
    ../../sdlc/shared/env-setup-workflow.md

    When environment issue detected:
    1. Detect the error (command not found, module errors, permission denied, etc.)
    2. Delegate to project online Dev Env mode with error context
    3. After environment fixed, retry original command and continue work
