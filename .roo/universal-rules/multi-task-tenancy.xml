<multi_task_tenancy>
  <critical_rule priority="MANDATORY">
    Multi-task development requires strict context isolation. Each task context must be isolated
    from other task contexts. Task-specific decisions stay in task context, not shared context.
    Only promote decisions to shared context when they affect multiple tasks.

    This is MANDATORY for all modes that use memory bank systems.
